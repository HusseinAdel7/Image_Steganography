> # Steganography

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret information.

The steganography hides different types of data within a cover file. 

The resulting stego file also contains hidden information, although it is virtually identical to the cover file.

> ## Image Steganography
 Image steganography refers to hiding information i.e. text, images, audios, videos, scripts, exe files in another image.
 
I rely on two directions in this tool to hide information in an image:

#### $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ 1- LSB Method

#### $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ 2- Hexa Decimal for the Image

> ### 1- LSB Method 

The Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography is one technique in which the least significant bit of the image is replaced with a data bit. In this method, the least significant bits of some or all of the bytes inside an image are replaced with a bit of the secret message.

> ### 2- Hexa Decimal for the Image

Every JPEG/JPG file just like any other object has a beginning or header, called “Start of Image” and a trailer called “End of Image”, every JPEG file starts from the binary value ‘0xFFD8‘ and ends by the binary value ‘0xFFD9‘.

After this value '0xFFD9' we insert our information.

We know that exe file starts with '0x4D5A'.

#### An image shows that we hid an exe in an image

## There is a demo 

Each file has an original image and injected image.
If you want to extract information use this key '###'
